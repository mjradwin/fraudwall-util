Defines a special kind of checksum called a <em>fingerprint</em>. Unlike cryptographic
hash functions like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5">MD5</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA1">SHA-1</a>, which were designed to
withstand cryptographic attacks, the fingerprint function was explicitly designed
to produce a checksum unique to the text from which it was generated.<p>

In particular, there is a mathematical formula that places an upper bound on the
probability of two randomly chosen (distinct) strings hashing to the same fingerprint.
By choosing a large enough fingerprint, the probability of a collision can be made
vanishingly small. Hence, the fingerprint of a text <em>T</em> can be used as a
fixed-size unique identifier for <em>T</em>.
