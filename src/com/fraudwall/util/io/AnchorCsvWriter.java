/**
 * Simple class for writing to CSV files based on the CsvWriter implementation,
 * but without the bug that causes IOExceptions to be silently ignored. There is
 * a code style test to ensure that this class is used instead of CsvWriter.
 * <p>
 * All constructors use the {@link IOUtils#UTF8} character set to convert from
 * characters to bytes. All constructors of this class guarantee that the output
 * is buffered for better performance.
 * <p>
 * Lines in the output file are separated by the value of the "line.separator"
 * property.
 * <p>
 * The individual fields on each output line are separated by a delimiter. The
 * default delimiter is the "," (comma) character, but some of the constructors
 * allow a different delimiter to be supplied, and the {@link #setDelimiter(char)}
 * method can be called even after the writer has been constructed.
